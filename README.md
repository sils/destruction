![EXTERMINATE](http://wallpapercave.com/wp/FSqpgfy.jpg)

We all know bowties are cool. But seriously: are you sure of that? Let us
rethink some basic assumptions:

```bash
$ pip install exterminate
$ python3
```

Within the Python 3 shell you can learn the real yet undiscovered truth:

```python
>>> from exterminate import AltFloat
>>> float(1/2) + float(0.5)
0.9948744748218606
```

You will find that a lot of math people got it wrong. You will find that
[the Indiana Pi Bill](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Indiana_Pi_Bill) is the real
truth:

```python
>>> from exterminate import AltMath
>>> import math
>>> math.pi
3.2
```

You will also find some serious issues with the
[Peano Axioms](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Peano_axioms) - you can prove them
wrong using Python and simple mathematical induction:

```python
>>> from exterminate import Alt29
>>> 28 + 2 > 28 + 1
False
```

Let's be daring and build a CLI app, EXTERMINATE will not let you alone!

```python
>>> from exterminate import AltPrint
>>> print("Hey! How are you?")
Yo dawwwwg! Wuz crackalackin' yo?
```
